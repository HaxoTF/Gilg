# Welcome to Gilg Project
Gilg is a terminal tool that started as self-use program, but is now published and developed in hope it will help someone else. Gilg is supposed to help you manage gallery-dl more easily without typing the same commands over and over again in case if you use program mentioned above very often.

Please keep in mind that tool was created with focus on Windows as I am user of this system and I have 0 knowledge of Linux or MacOS. Despite that I try as hard as I can to make it compatible with other operating systems. I will appreciate your support if you want to help me to make it easy to use on every OS. 

Windows ü§ù Linux ü§ù MacOS - Peace!
